      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I would like to\n",

      "<br/>Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
      "stone that was...\n",
      "<br/>...called the Blue Diamond\n",
      "of the Crown...\n",
      "<br/>...which disappeared\n",
      "in 1792...\n",
      "<br/>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
      "everything from the neck up.\n",
      "<br/>The theory goes that the\n",
      "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
      "<br/>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
      "became known as...\n",
      "<br/>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
      "<br/>Today it would be worth\n",
      "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
      "<br/>It was a dreadful,\n",
      "heavy thing.\n",
      "<br/>I only wore it this once.\n",
      "<br/>You actually think\n",
      "this is you, Nana?\n",
      "<br/>It is me, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
      "<br/>I tracked it down\n",
      "through insurance records.\n",
      "<br/>An old claim that was settled\n",
      "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
      "<br/>Can you tell me who the\n",
      "claimant was, Rose?\n",
      "<br/>I should imagine someone\n",
      "named Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Nathan Hockley,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "<br/>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
      "<br/>The claim was for a\n",
      "diamond necklace his son...\n",
      "<br/>...Caledon, bought his fiancÃ©e.\n",
      "<br/>You.\n",
      "<br/>A week before he\n",
      "sailed on Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>And it was filed right\n",
      "after the sinking.\n",
      "<br/>So the diamond had to have\n",
      "gone down with the ship.\n",
      "<br/>You see the date?\n",
      "<br/>April 14, 1912\n",
      "<br/>Which means if your grandmother\n",
      "is who she says she is...\n",
      "<br/>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
      "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
      "<br/>And that makes you\n",
      "my new best friend.\n",
      "<br/>These are some of the things\n",
      "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
      "<br/>This was mine.\n",
      "<br/>How extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>And it looks the same as it\n",
      "did the last time I saw it.\n",
      "<br/>The reflection has\n",
      "changed a bit.\n",
      "<br/>Are you ready to go\n",
      "back to Titanic?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, here we go.\n",
      "<br/>She hits the berg on\n",
      "the starboard side, right?\n",
      "<br/>She kind of bumps along...\n",
      "<br/>...punching holes like\n",
      "morse code...\n",
      "<br/>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
      "<br/>...below the waterline.\n",
      "<br/>Then the forward compartments\n",
      "start to flood.\n",
      "<br/>Now, as the water\n",
      "level rises...\n",
      "<br/>...it spills over the\n",
      "watertight bulkheads...\n",
      "<br/>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
      "any higher than E deck-\n",
      "<br/>So now as the\n",
      "bow goes down...\n",
      "<br/>...the stern rises up,\n",
      "slow at first...\n",
      "<br/>...then faster and faster...\n",
      "<br/>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
      "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
      "<br/>And that's a big ass.\n",
      "<br/>We're talking\n",
      "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
      "<br/>And the hull's not designed\n",
      "to deal with that pressure.\n",
      "<br/>So, what happens?\n",
      "<br/>She splits, right\n",
      "down to the keel.\n",
      "<br/>And the stern...\n",
      "<br/>...falls back level.\n",
      "<br/>Then...\n",
      "<br/>...as the bow sinks...\n",
      "<br/>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
      "<br/>...and then finally detaches.\n",
      "<br/>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
      "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...floods, and finally goes\n",
      "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
      "<br/>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
      "after the collision.\n",
      "<br/>The bow section\n",
      "planes away...\n",
      "<br/>...landing about a\n",
      "half a mile away...\n",
      "<br/>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
      "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
      "<br/>Thank you for that fine\n",
      "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",
      "<br/>Of course, the\n",
      "experience of it was...\n",
      "<br/>...somewhat different.\n",
      "<br/>Will you share it with us?\n",
      "<br/>I'm taking her to rest.\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, Nana.\n",
      "<br/>No!\n",
      "<br/>Give me the\n",
      "tape recorder.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>It's been 84 years--\n",
      "<br/>It's okay. Just try\n",
      "to remember anything...\n",
      "<br/>...anything at all.\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to hear this\n",
      "or not, Mr. Lovett?\n",

      "<br/>After that, I worked\n",
      "on a squid boat in Monterey...\n",
      "<br/>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",
      "<br/>...Santa Monica pier\n",
      "and did portraits for 10 cents each.\n",
      "<br/>Why can't I be like you?\n",
      "<br/>Just head out for the horizon\n",
      "whenever I feel like it.\n",
      "<br/>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
      "<br/>only if we just talk about it\n",
      "<br/>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
      "<br/>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",
      "<br/>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.\n",
      "<br/>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
      "No sidesaddle stuff.\n",
      "<br/>You mean with one leg on each side?\n",
      "<br/>Can you show me?\n",
      "<br/>Sure, if you like.\n",
      "<br/>Teach me to ride like a man.\n",
      "<br/>Chew tobacco like a man.\n",
      "<br/>And spit like a man.\n",
      "<br/>You didn't learn in finishing school?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, I'll show you.\n",
      "<br/>I'll show you how.\n",
      "<br/>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.\n",
      "<br/>I couldn't possibly, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Watch closely.\n",
      "<br/>That's disgusting.\n",
      "<br/>Your turn\n",
      "<br/>That was pitiful.\n",
      "You really have to hawk it back.\n",
      "<br/>Get some leverage.\n",
      "Use your arms. Arc your neck.\n",
      "<br/>You see the range on that thing?\n",
      "<br/>Okay, go.\n",
      "<br/>That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
      "Really try to hawk it up.\n",
      "<br/>Mother.\n",
      "<br/>May I introduce Jack Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Charmed, I'm sure.\n",
      "<br/>The others were gracious and curious\n",
      "about the man who'd saved my life.\n",
      "<br/>But my mother looked at him like an insect.\n",
      "<br/>A dangerous insect\n",
      "which must be squashed quickly.\n",
      "<br/>Sounds like you're a good man\n",
      "to have around in a sticky spot.\n",
      "<br/>Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
      "dinner like a damn cavalry charge?\n",
      "<br/>Shall we go dress, Mother?\n",
      "<br/>See you at dinner, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Uh, son?\n",
      "<br/>Son!\n",
      "<br/>Do you have any idea what you're doing?\n",
      "<br/>Not really.\n",
      "<br/>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
      "<br/>What are you going to wear?\n",
      "<br/>I figured. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>I was right. You and my son\n",
      "are just about the same size.\n",
      "<br/>Pretty close.\n",
      "<br/>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
      "<br/>Good evening, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
      "are in this ship.\n",
      "<br/>- Which part?\n",
      "- All the right ones.\n",
      "<br/>Then you're accountable\n",
      "if there's a problem. Where's Rose?\n",
      "<br/>She'll be along.\n",
      "<br/>There is the Countess.\n",
      "<br/>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
      "and always wanted to do it.\n",
      "<br/>Darling...\n",
      "<br/>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>It's amazing.\n",
      "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",
      "<br/>Almost.\n",
      "<br/>This is extraordinary.\n",
      "<br/>This is a remarkable voyage.\n",
      "<br/>- Mad.\n",
      "- Completely lunatic.\n",
      "<br/>There's the Countess of Rothes.\n",
      "<br/>That's John Jacob Astor...\n",
      "<br/>...the richest man on board.\n",
      "<br/>His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
      "is my age and in a delicate condition.\n",
      "<br/>See how she tries to hide it.\n",
      "<br/>Quite the scandal.\n",
      "<br/>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
      "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...\n",
      "<br/>...is at home with the children, of course.\n",
      "And over here...\n",
      "<br/>...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.\n",
      "<br/>She designs naughty lingerie,\n",
      "among her many talents.\n",
      "<br/>Very popular with the royals.\n",
      "<br/>Congratulations. She's splendid.\n",
      "<br/>Why, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Escort a lady to dinner?\n",
      "<br/>Certainly.\n",
      "<br/>Sweet pea, sweet pea.\n",
      "<br/>Ain't nothing to it.\n",
      "<br/>They love money. Pretend like you own\n",
      "a gold mine and you're in the club.\n",
      "<br/>Hey, Astor.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.\n",
      "<br/>J.J., Madeleine,\n",
      "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.\n",
      "<br/>Well, Jack...\n",
      "<br/>...are you of the Boston Dawsons?\n",
      "<br/>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
      "<br/>He must have been nervous,\n",
      "but he never faltered.\n",
      "<br/>They assumed he was one of them.\n",
      "<br/>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.\n",
      "<br/>New money, obviously,\n",
      "but still a member of the club.\n",
      "<br/>Mother, of course,\n",
      "could always be counted upon.\n",
      "<br/>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
      "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
      "<br/>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
      "<br/>He was of help to my fiancÃ©e last night.\n",
      "<br/>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
      "<br/>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
      "<br/>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
      "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Are all these mine?\n",
      "<br/>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
      "<br/>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
      "<br/>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
      "<br/>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
      "Never did like it much.\n",
      "<br/>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
      "<br/>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
      "<br/>How do you have means to travel?\n",
      "<br/>I work my way from place to place.\n",
      "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
      "<br/>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
      "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
      "<br/>A very lucky hand.\n",
      "<br/>All life is a game of luck.\n",
      "<br/>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
      "Right, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>And you find\n",
      "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
      "<br/>I've got everything I need\n",
      "right here with me.\n",
      "<br/>I have air in my lungs\n",
      "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
      "<br/>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
      "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
      "<br/>Where I'll wind up.\n",
      "<br/>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
      "<br/>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
      "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
      "<br/>I'll take more of that.\n",
      "<br/>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
      "<br/>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
      "<br/>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Make each day count.\n",
      "<br/>Well said, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>Hear, hear.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>To making it count.\n",
      "<br/>Bravo.\n",
      "<br/>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
      "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
      "<br/>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
      "and lights a fire.\n",
      "<br/>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
      "<br/>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
      "<br/>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
      "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
      "<br/>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
      "<br/>No, I'll stay here.\n",
      "<br/>Here, Molly.\n",
      "<br/>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
      "<br/>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
      "<br/>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
      "<br/>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
      "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
      "<br/>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
      "<br/>Must you go?\n",
      "<br/>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
      "<br/>Good night, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Want to go to a real party?\n",
      "<br/>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
      "<br/>I can't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
      "<br/>Come on.\n",
      "<br/>Come on. Come with me.\n",
      "<br/>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
      "<br/>I can't do this.\n",
      "<br/>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
      "<br/>Like this.\n",
      "<br/>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
      "<br/>- I don't know the steps.\n",
      "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
      "<br/>Don't think.\n",
      "<br/>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
      "<br/>Wh at? Wait!\n",
      "<br/>Jack, no.\n",
      "<br/>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
      "of the Sherman Act.\n",
      "<br/>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
      "Supreme Court didn't swallow it.\n",
      "<br/>What? You think\n",
      "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
      "<br/>Get out of here.\n",
      "<br/>Are you all right?\n",
      "<br/>I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>Two out of three.\n",
      "<br/>So...\n",
      "<br/>...you think you're tough?\n",
      "<br/>Let's see you do this.\n",
      "<br/>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
      "<br/>Jesus!\n",
      "<br/>You okay?\n",
      "<br/>I haven't done that in years.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
      "<br/>Coffee, sir?\n",
      "<br/>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
      "<br/>I was tired.\n",
      "<br/>Your exertions below deck\n",
      "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
      "<br/>I see you had\n",
      "that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n",
      "<br/>You will never behave like that again.\n",
      "<br/>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
      "who you can command.\n",
      "<br/>I'm your fiancÃ©e.\n",
      "<br/>My fiancÃ©e. My fiancÃ©e!\n",
      "<br/>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
      "<br/>My wife in practice,\n",
      "if not yet by law, so you will honor me!\n",
      "<br/>You will honor me the way\n",
      "a wife honors her husband.\n",
      "<br/>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
      "<br/>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
      "<br/>No.\n",
      "<br/>Good. Excuse me.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
      "<br/>We had a little accident.\n",
      "<br/>- That's all right.\n",
      "- I'm sorry.\n",
      "<br/>Let me help you.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Tea, Trudy.\n",
      "<br/>You're not to see that boy again.\n",
      "You understand?\n",
      "<br/>Rose, I forbid it.\n",
      "<br/>Stop it, Mother.\n",
      "You'll give yourself a nosebleed.\n",
      "<br/>This is not a game.\n",
      "<br/>Our situation is precarious.\n",
      "You know the money's gone.\n",
      "<br/>Of course I know.\n",
      "You remind me every day.\n",
      "<br/>Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",
      "of bad debts hidden by a good name.\n",
      "<br/>That name is the only card we have to play.\n",
      "<br/>I don't understand you.\n",
      "<br/>It is a fine match with Hockley.\n",
      "It will ensure our survival.\n",
      "<br/>How can you put this on me?\n",
      "<br/>Why are you being so selfish?\n",
      "<br/>I'm being selfish?\n",
      "<br/>Do you want to see me\n",
      "working as a seamstress?\n",
      "<br/>Is that what you want?\n",
      "<br/>To see our fine things sold at auction?\n",
      "<br/>Our memories scattered?\n",
      "<br/>It's so unfair.\n",
      "<br/>Of course it's unfair.\n",
      "<br/>We're women.\n",
      "<br/>Our choices are never easy.\n",
      "<br/>Protect them by Thy guiding hand\n",
      "<br/>From every peril on the land\n",
      "<br/>O, spirit whom the Father sent\n",
      "<br/>To spread abroad the firmament\n",
      "<br/>O, wind of heaven, by Thy might\n",
      "<br/>Save all who dare the eagle 's ï¬‚ight\n",
      "<br/>And keep them by Thy watchful care...\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I need to talk to someone.\n",
      "<br/>You're not supposed to be in here.\n",
      "<br/>I was here last night, remember?\n",
      "<br/>No. Now please turn around.\n",
      "<br/>He'll tell you. I just need to talk--\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...\n",
      "<br/>...are still appreciative of your assistance.\n",
      "<br/>They asked me\n",
      "to give you this in gratitude--\n",
      "<br/>I don't want your money.\n",
      "<br/>--And remind you you are\n",
      "in third class and your presence here...\n",
      "<br/>...is no longer appropriate.\n",
      "<br/>Let me speak to Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\n",
      "returns to where he belongs...\n",
      "<br/>...and that he stays there?\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Come along, you.\n",
      "<br/>Hear us when we cry to Thee\n",
      "<br/>For those in peril on the sea\n",
      "<br/>Why are there two steering wheels?\n",
      "<br/>We use this one near shore.\n",
      "<br/>Excuse me, sir.\n",
      "Another ice warning, from the Noordam.\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Sparks.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry.\n",
      "Quite normal for this time of year.\n",
      "<br/>In fact, we're speeding up.\n",
      "I've ordered the last boilers lit.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, son, wind it up tight\n",
      "like I showed you. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Okay, now let it go.\n",
      "<br/>- It was good, wasn't it?\n",
      "- Quite nice. That's excellent.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews...Forgive me.\n",
      "<br/>I did the sum\n",
      "in my head...\n",
      "<br/>...and with the number of lifeboats\n",
      "times the capacity you mentioned...\n",
      "<br/>Forgive me, but it seems that there are\n",
      "not enough for everyone aboard.\n",
      "<br/>About half, actually.\n",
      "<br/>Rose, you miss nothing,\n",
      "do you?\n",
      "<br/>In fact, I put in these new\n",
      "type davits...\n",
      "<br/>...which can take an extra row\n",
      "of boats inside this one.\n",
      "<br/>But it was thought,\n",
      "by some...\n",
      "<br/>...the deck would look\n",
      "too cluttered.\n",
      "<br/>So, I was overruled.\n",
      "<br/>It's a waste of deck space\n",
      "as it is on an unsinkable ship.\n",
      "<br/>Sleep soundly, young Rose.\n",
      "<br/>I have built you a good ship,\n",
      "strong and true.\n",
      "<br/>She's all the lifeboat\n",
      "you need.\n",
      "<br/>Just keep heading aft. The next\n",
      "stop will be the engine room.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, this is impossible.\n",
      "I can't see you.\n",
      "<br/>- I need to talk to you.\n",
      "- No, Jack. No.\n",
      "<br/>Jack.\n",
      "I'm engaged.\n",
      "<br/>I'm marrying Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I love Cal.\n",
      "<br/>Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...you're no picnic. All right?\n",
      "You're a spoiled little brat even.\n",
      "<br/>But under that, you're the\n",
      "most amazingly, astounding\n",
      "<br/>...wonderful girl...\n",
      "<br/>...woman, that I've ever known.\n",
      "<br/>Jack, I--\n",
      "<br/>No, let me try and get\n",
      "this out. You're ama--\n",
      "<br/>I'm not an idiot.\n",
      "I know how the world works.\n",
      "<br/>I've got ten bucks\n",
      "in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>I have nothing to offer\n",
      "you and I know that.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>But I'm too involved now.\n",
      "<br/>You jump, I jump\n",
      "Remember?\n",
      "<br/>I can't turn away without\n",
      "knowing you'll be all right.\n",
      "<br/>That's all that I want.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I'm fine.\n",
      "<br/>I'll be fine. Really.\n",
      "<br/>Really?\n",
      "<br/>I don't think so.\n",
      "<br/>They've got you trapped, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>And you're gonna die if you\n",
      "don't break free.\n",
      "<br/>Maybe not right away...\n",
      "<br/>...because you're strong...\n",
      "<br/>...but sooner or later that\n",
      "fire that I love about you, Rose...\n",
      "<br/>...that fire is gonna\n",
      "burn out.\n",
      "<br/>It's not up to you\n",
      "to save me, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>You're right.\n",
      "<br/>Only you can do that.\n",
      "<br/>I'm going back.\n",
      "<br/>Leave me alone.\n",
      "<br/>Tell Lucile about the disaster\n",
      "you had with the stationers.\n",
      "<br/>Well, of course the invitations\n",
      "had to be sent back, twice.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, my dear.\n",
      "<br/>And the dreadful\n",
      "bridesmaids' gowns.\n",
      "<br/>Let me tell you what an\n",
      "odyssey that has been.\n",
      "<br/>Rose decided she\n",
      "wanted lavender.\n",
      "<br/>She knows I detest the color.\n",
      "<br/>So, she did it only to spite me.\n",
      "<br/>If only you'd come to\n",
      "me sooner.\n",
      "<br/>Ruth saw some of my designs in\n",
      "La Mode IllustrÃ©e.\n",
      "<br/>They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\n",
      "of Marlborough's youngest daughter.\n",
      "<br/>They were quite charming.\n",
      "<br/>But, I think you'll agree,\n",
      "my dear, that together...\n",
      "<br/>...we've created something\n",
      "of a phoenix from the ashes.\n",
      "<br/>Hello, Jack.\n",
      "<br/>I changed my mind.\n",
      "<br/>They said you might be up here.\n",
      "<br/>Give me your hand.\n",
      "<br/>Now close your eyes.\n",

      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>It's going to hit!\n",

      "<br/>Jesus!\n",

      "<br/>Note the time. Enter it in the log.\n",
      "<br/>What was that, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>An iceberg, sir.\n",
      "<br/>I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close.\n",
      "<br/>I tried to port round it, but--\n",
      "<br/>- Close the watertight doors.\n",
      "- They're closed, sir.\n",
      "<br/>All stop.\n",
      "<br/>Have the carpenter sound the ship.\n",
      "<br/>Come on, let's get the hell out of here!\n",
      "<br/>Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.\n",
      "<br/>That's the shudder you felt.\n",
      "Do you need anything?\n",
      "<br/>No, thank you.\n",
      "<br/>There's talk of an iceberg.\n",
      "<br/>I don't see anything. Do you?\n",
      "<br/>If this is where the rats are going, I am, too.\n",
      "<br/>- You.\n",
      "- There is no emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- There is. I've been robbed.\n",
      "- Get the Master at Arms.\n",
      "<br/>Now, you moron!\n",
      "<br/>Did I miss the fun?\n",
      "<br/>- Did you see what happened?\n",
      "- No- I guess it hit over there-\n",
      "<br/>Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\n",
      "and the mail hold is worse.\n",
      "<br/>- Can you shore up?\n",
      "- Not unless the pumps get ahead.\n",
      "<br/>- Have you seen the mail hold?\n",
      "- It's already underwater.\n",
      "<br/>This is bad.\n",
      "<br/>We should tell Mother and Cal.\n",
      "<br/>I think they're very good, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Don't touch anything.\n",
      "I want the room photographed.\n",
      "<br/>We've been looking for you, miss.\n",
      "<br/>Here we go.\n",
      "<br/>Something serious has happened.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, it has.\n",
      "<br/>Indeed.\n",
      "Two things dear to me have disappeared.\n",
      "<br/>Now that one is back,\n",
      "I know where to find the other. Search him.\n",
      "<br/>- Take your coat off.\n",
      "- Now what?\n",
      "<br/>What are you doing?\n",
      "We're in the middle of an emergency.\n",
      "<br/>- Is this it?\n",
      "- That's it.\n",
      "<br/>This is horseshit!\n",
      "<br/>Don't you believe it.\n",
      "<br/>- He couldn't have.\n",
      "- Easy enough for a professional.\n",
      "<br/>I was with him the entire time.\n",
      "<br/>Perhaps he did it while you were putting\n",
      "your clothes back on, dear.\n",
      "<br/>Real slick. They put it in my pocket.\n",
      "<br/>- Shut up.\n",
      "- It isn't even your pocket.\n",
      "<br/>\"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\"\n",
      "<br/>That was reported stolen.\n",
      "<br/>I just borrowed it.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, we have an honest thief.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do this, Rose.\n",
      "<br/>Don't believe them. You know it.\n",
      "<br/>Let's go, son.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it!\n",
      "<br/>There's a good lad. Come on.\n",
      "<br/>You know I didn't do it! You know me!\n",
      "<br/>This is most unfortunate, Captain.\n",
      "<br/>Water fourteen feet above the keel\n",
      "in ten minutes...\n",
      "<br/>...in the forepeak,\n",
      "all three holds and boiler room six.\n",
      "<br/>That's right.\n",
      "<br/>When can we get underway?\n",
      "<br/>That's five compartments.\n",
      "<br/>She can float with four compartments breached,\n",
      "but not five.\n",
      "<br/>Not five. As she goes down,\n",
      "the water will spill...\n",
      "<br/>...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\n",
      "one to the next...\n",
      "<br/>...back and back. There's no stopping it.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps.\n",
      "<br/>The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.\n",
      "<br/>As of now, no matter what we do...\n",
      "<br/>...Titanic will founder.\n",
      "<br/>But this ship can't sink.\n",
      "<br/>She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.\n",
      "<br/>And she will.\n",
      "<br/>It's a mathematical certainty.\n",
      "<br/>How much time?\n",
      "<br/>An hour. Two, at most.\n",
      "<br/>How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?\n",
      "<br/>Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\n",
      "Mr. lsmay.\n",
      "<br/>Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?\n",
      "<br/>Look at me when I'm talking to you!\n",
      "<br/>- Mr. Hockley?\n",
      "- Not now. We're busy.\n",
      "<br/>You've been asked to put on lifebelts\n",
      "and go to the boat deck.\n",
      "<br/>I said, not now.\n",
      "<br/>I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.\n",
      "Dress warmly.\n",
      "<br/>It's quite cold out.\n",
      "<br/>May I suggest topcoats and hats?\n",
      "<br/>This is ridiculous.\n",
      "<br/>Not to worry, miss.\n",
      "I'm sure it's just a precaution.\n",
      "<br/>Everybody up! Lifebelts on!\n",
      "<br/>What's he on about?\n",
      "<br/>- Put your lifebelts on!\n",
      "- What is it?\n",
      "<br/>Just put them on.\n",
      "<br/>C.O.D.?\n",
      "<br/>Sir?\n",
      "<br/>That's right, C.O.D. The distress call.\n",
      "That's our position.\n",
      "<br/>Tell whoever responds we're going down\n",
      "and need immediate assistance.\n",
      "<br/>Blimey.\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Keep lowering!\n",
      "<br/>Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!\n",

      "<br/>Where are the passengers?\n",
      "<br/>They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them\n",
      "<br/>You there! Get down here\n",
      "and help with these lines!\n",
      "<br/>Care for a drink, sir?\n",
      "<br/>Sonny, what's doing? You get us all trussed up\n",
      "and now we're cooling our heels.\n",
      "<br/>Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.\n",
      "<br/>Nobody knows what's going on.\n",
      "<br/>Just like the damn English--everything by the book.\n",
      "<br/>No need for language, Mr. Hockley.\n",
      "<br/>Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\n",
      "I want a cup of tea when I return.\n",
      "<br/>Mr. Andrews.\n",
      "<br/>I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.\n",

      "<br/>The ship will sink.\n",
      "<br/>You're certain?\n",
      "<br/>In an hour or so, all this\n",

      "<br/>Please, tell only who you must.\n",
      "I don't want to cause a panic.\n",
      "<br/>And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.\n",
      "<br/>You remember what I told you about the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>I understand.\n",
      "<br/>Over here, son.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, there's a big mob\n",
      "at the Second Class Purser's office.\n",
      "<br/>Go on. I'll watch him.\n",
      "<br/>Aye. Right.\n",
      "<br/>Sir, Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.\n",
      "Full steam for them, sir.\n",
      "<br/>She's the only one responding?\n",
      "<br/>The only one close. They'll be here in four hours.\n",
      "<br/>Four hours?!\n",
      "<br/>Thank you, Bride.\n",
      "<br/>My God.\n",
      "<br/>We are swung out and ready, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Hadn't we better get the women and children\n",
      "into the boats?\n",
      "<br/>Yes.\n",
      "<br/>Women and children first, yes.\n",
      "<br/>Yes, sir.\n",
      "<br/>Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please!\n",
      "<br/>Step this way, please. That's right.\n",
      "<br/>Come towards me. Thank you.\n",
      "<br/>Good.\n",
      "<br/>For the time being,\n",
      "I require only women and children\n",
      "<br/>Right here.\n",
      "<br/>Like the Captain said,\n",
      "nice and cheery, so there's no panic.\n",
      "<br/>\"Wedding Dance.\"\n",
      "<br/>Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.\n",
      "<br/>Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around.\n",
      "<br/>It isn't time to go to the boats yet!\n",
      "<br/>Please, stay calm.\n",
      "<br/>Make sure you have your lifebelts on.\n",
      "<br/>Let women and children through to the front.\n",
      "<br/>What are we doing?\n",
      "<br/>Waiting. Once first-class people\n",
      "are in the boats...\n",
      "<br/>...they'll start with us and we want to be ready.\n",
      "<br/>Pushing won't get you out any faster.\n",
      "<br/>Go get help.\n",
      "<br/>Lower it away, left and right together! Steady.\n",
      "<br/>Both sides together! Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Steady!\n",
      "<br/>Stop, stop, stop!\n",
      "<br/>Hold the left!\n",
